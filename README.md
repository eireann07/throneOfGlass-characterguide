**What I enjoyed while building this app:** Taking the time to slow down and more thoughtfully consider components and how they work -- it's nice to slow down to be sure that I'm building components and component trees as effectively as possible, while also concentrating on code readability. 

**What I struggled with while building this app:** Stopping! The really good practice with components was one thing, but I'm also passionate about #booktok-inspired content, and *Throne of Glass* is one of my favorite series. 

**Things I learned through building this app:** Having a clear end goal is essential, because when you're really passionate about the content of a project, it can be difficult to stop and be finished.
